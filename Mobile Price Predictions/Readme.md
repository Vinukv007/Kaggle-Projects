You don't have good knowledge about how to mark a price produced by your company. As you have a good knowledge of ML & DS you started searching for some dataset related to mobile sales for various companies and you are able to find a small dataset around it.

Now you are required to build a machine learning model to predict the price to mark for the mobiles produced by your company.
